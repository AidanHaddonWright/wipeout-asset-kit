# wipEout Team Asset Kits

## Introduction

This kit allows you to create your own remixes of the team branding from the 
wipEout series.

I started this project because I wanted some wipEout themed wallpapers but was 
disappointed by the lack of options.

All the official assets and wallpapers are low quality by today's standards - 
even fan creations are getting old now. I tried to use AI upscaling hoping to 
get some HD wallpapers but they were getting warped when upscaled from 1080p and
beyond.

I realised that if I wanted some wipEout themed wallpapers, I would just have to 
make them myself.

So here's a wipEout themed asset kit. It's not fully comprehensive which is why 
I've made it open source.

Where I wasn't able to find official SVGs or fonts, I've tried my best to
recreate them, or find appropriate repacements.

All assets in this repository are free for personal use and links to the 
original authors are provided if they are known.

I will update this periodically as I discover more assets but if you would like
to make your own contributions, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Contribution Rules

### Rules For Crediting

Every folder contains a `credits.md` file. When adding new assets, please make 
sure to credit the creators where possible and follow these rules:

1. When you add a new asset, please add the filename as a 1st-level header to 
the file, and make sure all files are in alphabetical order. E.g:

```md
# name-of-file.extension
...
```

2. If you created the asset, please add your name and website (if you have one).
E.g:

```md
# name-of-file.extension

Created by **Your Name Here**.

Website https://yoursitehere.com
...
```

3. If you created the asset but it's based on an original, and the original 
authors are known, please list them like so:

```md
# name-of-file.extension

Created by **Your Name Here**.

Website https://yoursitehere.com

Based on the works of:
- **List Of** - https://example.com
- **The Original** - https://example.com
- **Authors** - https://example.com
...
```

4. If you did not create the asset, please add the name of the original
creator, link to their website, and where you originally downloaded the asset 
from. If any of this information is unknown, leave a '?' Eg:

```md
# name-of-file.extension

Created by **Creator Name**

Created by ? <-- if unknown

Website https://example.com/

Downloaded from https://example.com/
...
```

5. If you did not create or add the asset, but you've made any ammendments, add
yourself to the contributors list. E.g:

```md
# name-of-file.extension

Created by **Author Name**

Website https://example.com/

Based on the works of:
    ...

Contributors:
    - **Contributor 1** - https://example.com/
    - **Contributor 2** - https://example.com/
    - ...
    - **Your Name Here** - https://yoursitehere.com/

```

### Asset Rules

The wipEout franchise spans across many games. Instead of using the game title,
please use the in-universe "league name" to distinguish assets. It makes more
sense to distinguish assets by the in-game lore since some assets are shared
between titles.

Also, please make sure that filenames use kebab-case and follow this naming
convention:

`[file type]-[league names]-[additional text].[extension]`

For example, if you added the Feisar logos, you would upload them as:
- logo-agrc.svg
- logo-agrc-alternate.svg (2048 has two different logos)
- logo-f3600.svg
- logo-fx300-fx400-text.svg (because the fonts are the same in both games)

If an asset doesn't belong to a particular league or belongs to all of them,
then you can omit the league name.

Please make sure all images are submitted in SVG format. SVG is a well known, 
universal format and allows users of this kit to create assets at any resolution.

Please avoid redundant words in filenames. For example, if you're uploading an
asset to the Feisar team directory, don't add 'feisar' to the filename.

### Examples

Feel free to add your own examples, but DO NOT edit any examples you don't own
unless given permission by the creator.
